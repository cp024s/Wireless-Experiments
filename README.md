# Wireless-Experiments

This repository contains MATLAB code for simulating various aspects of wireless communication systems, including fading, Doppler effects, channel estimation, and OFDM signal transmission and reception.

1. **Fading and Doppler Effects**
   - Simulate wireless channels with various fading models.
   - Introduce Doppler effects to account for mobility in communication scenarios.

2. **Least Square Channel Estimation**
   - Implement the Least Square technique for channel estimation in OFDM systems.
   - Evaluate the performance of the channel estimation technique.

3. **Zero-Forcing Equalizer**
   - Simulate the Zero-Forcing Equalizer in a wireless communication system.
   - Analyze the equalizer's impact on system performance.

4. **OFDM Signal Transmission and Reception**
   - Implement the entire OFDM signal processing chain, including modulation, transmission, and demodulation.
   - Evaluate the system's performance under various conditions.
